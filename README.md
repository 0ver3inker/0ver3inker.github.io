## About The Project


This is a personal website built with `Jekyll` and hosted on `Github Pages`, which is based on the new `Neumorphism` design trend and was developed with a mobile-first approach. This can be used by developers, who want to showcase their resume and portfolio. If you want to use this for your own website, just fork this repository.
